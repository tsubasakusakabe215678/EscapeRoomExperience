Suddenly you wake up in a dark room.

You: why am I here? What is this place?

SAW: I want to play a game.

You:I don't want to play this game!!! Let me out!!!!

SAW: NO, you don’t have the option to choose. Now, the rule is simple. 
If you escape, you live, if you don’t you’ll die.

SAW: There are hints in the rooms. Use your wisdom to escape.

You lose consciousness and wake up in a locked room of an abandoned hospital few hours later.
